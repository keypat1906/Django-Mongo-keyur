About

This is small project to demostrate the Django and MongoDB connectivity and it displays how we can use collections and print those collection using queryset.

I have used sample bank_data collection for this demo and it is available in parent directory.

Settings.py file has django and MongDB connectivty. You can browse all the require packages in requirement.txt

/bank api is checking for first_name and then it pulls all the last_name with that supplied first_name.

You dont have to specify the DATABASE name and engine in the settings.py file.
